## Yao Lei (Leo)

Now I am a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) student of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research project is utilizing latest Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data tools to leverage a mendelian disease named Neuromuscular disease genetic diagnosis rate.

My research interest are *genomics*, *transcriptomics*, *bioinformatics*, and *algorithm development*. I attended *introduction to biostatistics* and *Advanced statistics method* courses, therefore, have basic knowledge about statistics and probability. I am learning machine learning algorithms (SVM, PCA, KNN, K mean, etc) to better disentagle the mystery of biology.
